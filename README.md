# Brain

This repository contains a simple "Hello World" program written in Brainfuck.

## Description

Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language known for its minimalistic design and extreme simplicity. Programs written in Brainfuck typically consist of only eight commands: `+`, `-`, `>`, `<`, `[`, `]`, `.`, and `,`. Despite its simplicity, Brainfuck is Turing-complete, meaning it can theoretically compute any computable function.
